# EveryPill Reminder App

- Have you ever missed the time to take your medication?
- Do you struggle to keep track of the correct dosage and time of meds for you or your beloved ones, and you find it an almost impossible task?

If you feel like that, you're not alone. Due to our modern and active lifestyle, more than ever we need to take pills, vitamins, and tonics among others, to improve our health. It's almost an impossible task to manually control all of this, let alone if you need to control it for you and your beloved ones!

Thinking about that, AFMussap Tech has developed **EveryPill Reminder**: a powerful tool that helps you to keep track of your meds.

- Modern and intuitive interface
- Easy to use
- Push notification and sound reminder
- Share pharmaceutical information with others

Don't take a chance on missing the correct time and dosage of your medication. You can add as many as you need: Tablets, Capsules, Syrups, Injections, etc, there are no limitations. Additionally, you can add other relatives’ pharmaceutical information and manage them as prescribed.

With a few simple steps you can input individuals, and get hourly, daily, or weekly reminders.

!!! Note
No longer will you need to worry about forgetting time and dosage!

With **EveryPill Reminder**, pharmaceutical information can be shared(*) between users. This is a very useful feature in many situations.

**Think about this scenario:** you manage your child’s medicine. You’ll be away for few days and you ask your partner to take care of the child’s medicine. In this case, instead of your partner adding the medication to his/her App (add name, type, alarm, etc.), you can share the relevant information with him/her, and when they choose to accept it, it will be automatically added to his/her App.

**Just another example:** you’re taking a Vitamin. You friend tells you that he needs to take the same Vitamin. There’s no need for him to add all the required data to his App. If you share your Vitamin data with him, once he accepts it, the Vitamin will automatically be added to his App.

Sign in with your **Google** or **Facebook** account to use the **EveryPill Reminder Chat**. 

> Your data is always saved when you are logged in with an account, and it can be accessed on any device: no need to register again. 

You can also sign in as a Guest, but if you change devices your data will be lost.

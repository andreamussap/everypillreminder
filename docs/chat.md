# Chat

The **Chat** option is an easy way for you to communicate with others while using **EveryPill Reminder**

You can only talk to those who are already added as your friends.

- To talk to a friend for the first time, tap he/she from list of friends, then tap the **Chat** (envelop)icon.

## Delete chat 

> It's not possible to **delete** messages from the chat. 

If you really want to delete the messages from your App, you have delete your friend - so all your conversation will be deleted together with your friend. 

You can delete and add (re-add) the same friend as you wish, just bear in mind that this doesn't delete the messages from your friend's App.

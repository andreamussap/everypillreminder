# Important notes

## Facebook and Google are different accounts

Facebook and Google are different accounts, and the App treats them as such, even if your Facebook is associated to your Google email.

If you have both Google and Facebook, we advise you to choose one of them to use with **EveryPill Reminder**.

All information that you add (medication, friends, etc.) is *associated to the account that you used to log in to the App*. 

So, for example, you sign in with Google and add a medication. Then you sign out, and sign in again, but this time with Facebook. 

In this case, you *won't be able to access* the medication and friends that you previously added with Google, *even if your Facebook email is your Google email*!
 

## Facebook App is not installed on the smartphone

If you have a Facebook account but Facebook App is not installed on the smartphone, when you try to sign in to **EveryPill Reminder** with Facebook you will see the default Facebook screen to login to the application.

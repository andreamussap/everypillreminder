Don't take a chance on missing the correct time and dosage of your medication. You can add as many as you need: Tablets, Capsules, Syrups, Injections, etc, there are no limitations. Additionally, you can add other relatives’ pharmaceutical information and manage them as prescribed.

With a few simple steps you can input individuals, and get hourly, daily, or weekly reminders. No longer will you need to worry about forgetting time and dosage!

With **EveryPill Reminder** pharmaceutical information can be shared(*) between users. This is a very useful feature in many situations.

*Think about this scenario:* You manage your child’s medicine. You’ll be away for few days and you ask your partner to take care of the child’s medicine. In this case, instead of your partner adding the medication to his/her App (add name, type, alarm, etc.), you can share the relevant information with him/her, and when they choose to accept it, it will be automatically added to his/her App.

*Just another example:* You’re taking a Vitamin. You friend tells you that he needs to take the same Vitamin. There’s no need for him to add all the required data to his App. If you share your Vitamin data with him, once he accepts it, the Vitamin will automatically be added to his App.

Sign in with your *Google* or *Facebook* account to use the **EveryPill Reminder Chat**. Your data is always saved when you are logged in with an account, and it can be accessed on any device: no need to register again! 

You can also sign in as a Guest, but if you change devices your data will be lost.
